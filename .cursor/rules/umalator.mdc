# Umalator

In this project, you are developing a web interface for Uma Musume skill efficiency calculations. It is in `/umalator`. Use the already implemented tools in this repository, but try to limit the amount of changes you make to them.

If looking at code, limit yourself to the files in `/umalator` as well, unless you are stuck or specifically asked to look at other files.
